# Case study patterns with lambdas
The idea of the strategy pattern is to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate what varies into separate classes and make their objects interchangeable in the context. Varies here means: may change over time due to the evolving requirements.

Lambda expressions have changed the world in Java, and we can effectively use lambda expressions to avoid writing a lot of ceremonial code. As far as the strategy design pattern is concerned we don't have to create a hierarchy of classes. Instead, we can directly pass the strategy implementation of the interface as a lambda expression to the context.
